    'Moink Balls – Smoked Bacon Wrapped Meatballs',
    'MOINK. Well this is a crazy word isn\'t it? This word has been circulating around the internet BBQ world for quite some time. The general idea is that it came from “moo” and “oink” put together since you\'re using beef meatballs and pork bacon. MOINK balls are bacon wrapped meatballs that are smoked for about 1.5 hours. They are dusted with BBQ dry rub and brushed with BBQ sauce. I decided to give it a try. It\'s a really simple and tasty appetizer.',
    'Bag of meatballs from the frozen food section (not Italian seasoned); thawed\r\n\
    Any BBQ dry rub you have in your pantry\r\n\
    1 pack of bacon\r\n\
    Toothpicks\r\n\
    Any BBQ sauce you have lying around',
    'So go ahead and cut your bacon in half (see above photo) and get your meatballs out. Look in the pantry for that leftover BBQ dry rub and get that out too.\r\n\
    Take each thawed meatball and wrap it with half a piece of bacon. Stick a toothpick in to keep it secure. These meatballs were pretty small so a half a slice of bacon was more than enough. Too much bacon would actually not work well here, so stick with a half piece. Once all of the meatballs are wrapped with bacon and impaled with a toothpick shake the BBQ dry rub all over. This is why I don\'t use Italian flavored meatballs because I suspect the BBQ dry rub and Italian seasonings don\'t go too well together.\r\n\
    The assembled MOINK balls can sit in the fridge as long as you like. I made these in the morning and then smoked them in the afternoon.',
